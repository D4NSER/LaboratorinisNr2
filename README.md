# Specs
### To start this project's review, I need to give a little intro about my computer. I have a MacBook, with these specs:
    CPU: 2,3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 
    RAM: 6 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3 
    SSD: Macintosh HD 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All of the testing was done with the same files that contained 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000 students.

# Information about the project
## The rule of five
The "Rule of Five" is a programming guideline that outlines five essential C++ class members, which manipulate resources. If you define one of these operators, you should define the remaining four to ensure proper management of resources (such as memory) in your class.
## What does the rule of five contain?
### Destructor: 
Responsible for releasing resources allocated by the class. It's invoked when an object of the class is destroyed or goes out of scope.

     ~Studentas();
### Copy Constructor: 
Copies an object of the class, which uses the same resource(-es) as the original object. It's essential to ensure deep copying to avoid double deletion of the same resource.

    Studentas(const Studentas &other);
### Copy Assignment Operator: 
Corresponds to the " = " operator. It copies the given object into an existing object that already has the same or similar resources. It's crucial to ensure that existing resources are released before assigning new ones.

    Studentas &operator=(const Studentas &other);
### Move Constructor: 
Transfers resources from one object to another without copying them, simply transferring resource ownership. It's more efficient than deep copying because it doesn't copy resources but transfers them.

    Studentas(Studentas &&other) noexcept;
### Move Assignment Operator: 
Corresponds to the " = " operator but operates on moveable objects. Similar to the move constructor, it allows assigning another moveable object to an existing object, efficiently managing resources.

    Studentas &operator=(Studentas &&other) noexcept;

## Input/Output operator methods:
### Input and Output in the code:
#### Input: 
Input method let's us read the student data, which is a must.

    std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, Studentas& student)
#### Output: 
Output methods gives us the most crucial thing in our code - prints our results.

    std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Studentas& student)
>[!NOTE]
> These 2 parts are crucial for the code and without them they would simply not work

### Manual Usage: 
The operator >> method lets you manually input data from a stream (e.g., std::cin). With this method, you can directly input a student's name, surname, exam result, and homework grades from the terminal.

### Automatic Usage: 
The operator >> method can also automatically read data from another source, like a file. It enables reading from a file and populating a Student object with the data.



### To Screen: 
The operator << method allows you to display a Student object's data on the screen (e.g., std::cout). It outputs the student's name, surname, exam result, and homework grades to the terminal.

### To File: 
The operator << method can also be used to output data to a file. It lets you write a Student object's data to a file, which can later be read.

# The v1.5
## Structure
- `studentas.h` - Declaration of the Student class and its function descriptions.
- `zmogus.h` - Declaration of the abstract class Human and its function descriptions.
- `studentas.cpp` - Implementation of the Student class methods.

## Features
- Can create a new student and set their name, surname, homework, and exam results.
- Can calculate a student's average or median.
- Can calculate a student's final grade using either the average or median.
- Can generate random student data.

## Example usage

```
#include "studentas.h"
#include <iostream>

void testRuleOfFive()
{
    // Create an original student
    Studentas original("Mantas", "Globys");
    original.addNamuDarbas(8);
    original.addNamuDarbas(9);
    original.setEgzaminas(10);

    // Test copy constructor
    Studentas copy(original);
    cout << copy << endl;
    cout << original << endl;

    // Test copy assignment
    Studentas copyAssignment;
    copyAssignment = original;
    cout << copyAssignment << endl;
    cout << original << endl;

    // Test move constructor
    Studentas moved(std::move(original));
    cout << original << endl;
    cout << moved << endl;

    // Test move assignment
    Studentas moveAssignment;
    moveAssignment = std::move(moved);
    cout << moved << endl;
    cout << moveAssignment << endl;

    std::cout << "Rule of Five tests passed successfully!" << std::endl;

    int main(){
        testRuleOfFive();
}
```
## Timetable

| Number of Students | Time to Read Data (s) | Time to Sort Data (s) | Time to Divide Students (s) |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1000               | 0.034256341           | 0.000020692           | 0.000000411                 |
| 10000              | 0.247214881           | 0.000001050           | 0.000000340                 |
| 100000             | 2.334580174           | 0.000000970           | 0.000000178                 |
| 1000000            | 25.613205208          | 0.000000902           | 0.000000229                 |
| 10000000           | 237.982180909         | 0.000001003           | 0.000000174                 |

## Time comparison

    Comparing the two versions of the tables, it seems that v1.5 generally has slightly 
    lower times for reading data and dividing students across all student count categories. 
    However, v1.2 has slightly lower times for sorting data in some cases.

    In general, the differences between the two versions are relatively minor, so the choice 
    between them may not significantly impact the overall performance or interpretation of the data.


# The v2.0
>[!IMPORTANT]
>All of the tests before this were done on Mac, but because some of the parts are better done on Windows - this whole test was done on Windows11 VM

## Tasks for the last update
- Doxygen Documentation [^1]
- Unit Testing [^2]
- Github Editing [^3]

## Doxygen Documentation
>[!WARNING]
> In this document I will try to run through everything you need to know, but it would be lovely if you would go to YouTube and watch a tutorial video, because I do not specialize in this area

### Installation and Usage
1. Firstly, head up to the [official Doxygen website][https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html]
2. Press the download button and install the program for the desired OS
3. Set everything up and start the DoxygenWiz
4. Now select the exact folder of your project, where all the files are shown
5. Name your project, write your synopsis and the version, if you really need - add thee logo
6. Head up to Run window and press the **Run doxygen** button
7. Once the process finishes, just go right to your project files -> hmtl -> index.html
8. Open it and vola, you have your whole documentation

### Inside the code
>[!NOTE]
>Since Doxygen documentation only needs comments from header files, save your time and

1. Open all your project's haeder files and get ready for this long and exhausting job
2. First up, we need a little intro about how the comments are made and what are the rules:
   - **Comment Format:** Use a specific format for comments recognized by Doxygen, typically starting with /** or /*! to indicate a special comment block.
   - **Documentation Tags:** Utilize special tags like @brief, @param, @return, @see, etc., to provide structured information about your code elements.
   - **Class Documentation:** Document classes using /** blocks above the class declaration, providing descriptions, usage notes, and any relevant information.
   - **Function Documentation:** Document functions and methods with /** blocks preceding their declarations, including details such as parameters, return values, and usage examples.
   - **Variable Documentation:** Document variables using /** blocks above their declarations, specifying their purpose, usage guidelines, and any additional details.
   - **Grouping and Organization:** Group related elements together using \defgroup and \addtogroup commands to create logical hierarchies in your documentation.
   - **File-level Documentation:** Include file-level documentation using /** blocks at the beginning of each source file, describing its purpose, contents, and usage.
   - **Consistency and Clarity:** Maintain consistency in your commenting style and ensure clarity in your descriptions, making it easier for users to understand and navigate your documentation.
3. Now once you are all set, start commenting everything in your header files

## Unit Testing
>[!CAUTION]
>I hope you will stay as strong as I did throughout all the hell we will go now

### IDE

    Well, for starters, I used Visual Studio 2022 for Unit testing as it is one of the best IDE's 
    for this kind of job. You can also use JetBrains as it is even better.
     
### Setting everything up
>[!NOTE]
>Unit Testing, overviewed in this documentation is called Native Unit Testing

#### Preparing the project file
1. Firstly open **Visual Studio**
2. Press **Create New Project**
3. Select **Native Unit Testing** because VS will do all the job by creating and editing your properties you will need here
4. Now once the project is created head up to Project -> {name of the file} properties -> C/C++ -> All functions -> Precompiled Header and change it's value to **Not Using Precompiled Headers**
5. Now press **Apply** and **OK**
6. Now press Project button and add existing files that you will want to test
   
#### Making last changes to code
1. Once you do this, just write new functions that test whatever you need
2. Once it is all done, go to **Test** and open the **Test Explorer**
3. Now just press **Run all test** and you have it
4. If any of the builds fail, you will know that something is not working and if it does work, you are set

## How to run the code?
### Makefile creation
>[!NOTE]
>The Makefile was designed to ensure successful linking of various files in the code. This tutorial will demonstrate a few different methods for setting up and using the Makefile builder to execute my code.

>[!WARNING]
>Please be discrete when following these steps and after installing the compiler - configure it, because it will not work :) 

#### First method (Windows Hard Method)
1. **Go** to [this](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81/) website, which navigates you into the compilator download link (the original site).
2. **Download** the latest version of it.
3. **Setup** the whole thing. It has quite clear intruction, but if you ever struggle, here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taCJhnBXG_w) to help you!
4. Now, once you have this, head up to you **project** on File Explorer.
5. **Copy** the path of your project with all of the files (**INCLUDING THE MAKEFILE!**)
6. **Open** CMD (Command Prompt).
7. Type '**cd** ' and **paste** the path.
8. Now press enter and just to make sure, that you're in the right place, type '**ls**' and **check** if all the files are there.
9. Now just **type** 'make' and **wait**!
10. Once everything is done, simply **type** 'programa.exe' as it is my target in the makefile (the main file that all of other files got compiled to)
11. If **nothing** happends, you can add 'run' before the path.
12. **Have fun!**

#### Second method (MacBook Hard Method)
1. **Go** to the app store or into the internet and download [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) because you will need a compilator.
2. **Start** the Xcode after installing and configuring it.
3. **Go** to _Xcode/Preferences_.
4. Head up to the "_Downloads_" tab.
5. Click on "_Components_".
6. Press "_Install_" on the **command line tools line**.
7. Once all of this is done, head up the Finder and **locate** your project with all of the files (**INCLUDING THE MAKEFILE!**)
8. Now open up the **terminal** and type '**cd** '.
9. Head back to the finder and press on the **name** of you **project**. A file with a plus should've appeared by now.
10. **Drag** that file with a plus right **into the terminal** and press enter.
11. To make sure, you are in the right project **type** '**ls**' and **check** if all of the files are there.
12. Now **type** './' and the name of the file (in my case it's **programa**)
13. **Enjoy your time!**

#### Third method (The Smart One)
1. **Download** either Xcode or MinGW compilator (see above for both Windows and Mac).
2. Once the compilator is **installed** and set up. **Open** [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. Now open the **project**.
4. Go to the **extensions** tab and search for "**Makefile Tools**" By _Microsoft_.
5. **Download** it and then restart VSCode for it to actually get installed into your **IDE**.
6. Once this is done, press on the **extension** on the left side of the toolbar and you'll see 6 different paths, that the extension needs.
7. For **Windows**:
    - Edit the "**Make**" configuration to use mingw32-make.exe.
    - Edit the "**Makefile**" configuration and paste the project path.
8. For **MacBook**:
    - Edit the "**Make**" configuration to use /usr/bin/make.
    - Edit the "**Makefile**" configuration and paste the project path.
9. Now just press the "**Build**" button (top left one) which will build the project.
10. Then press the "**Run code**" button which will start it.
11. **Have fun!**

[^1]: Doxygen is a tool designed to automatically generate documentation from source code, primarily written in C++, but also supporting other programming languages. Its operation is based on specially written comment tags adjacent to the code. These tags, typically starting with the symbol /**, allow for writing structured and detailed documentation about code functions, class members, modules, and variables.
[^2]: Unit tests are intended to test individual parts (units) of a program to ensure they function correctly. This helps ensure that each part of the program performs the intended functions and behaves as expected.
